# Two-Phase-Simplex
This project implement two-phase simplex algorithm.

The standard form of simplex is positive RHS and '<' sign.
It can process negative RHS, '>' and '=' sign.

If ths the sign is '>' or '<', then the constraint need to add slack variables, and
if the sign is '>' or '=', then the constraint need to add artificial variables.
